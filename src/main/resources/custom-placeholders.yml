# Here you can set custom placeholders for anything.
# These placeholders can be used in any streamline messages.
# Example:
# ':foo:': bar
# In the example above, if the characters (in order and
# case-sensitive) ':foo:' (without the ' marks) were in
# a streamline message (including some chat messages),
# it would replace them with 'bar' (without the ' marks).
#
# WARNING : Putting the ' marks ensures that the plugin
# does not get confused or corrupt messages.
